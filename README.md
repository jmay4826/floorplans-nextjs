# floorplans-nextjs

This project is a refactor of an [older project](https://github.com/jmay4826/server) written in AngularJS and rewritten from the ground up in React using Next.js with Apollo and GraphQL. This version is still in progress, so check out the [older version](https://github.com/jmay4826/server) for a full demo! 

The [backend for this project](https://github.com/jmay4826/graphql-floorplans) GraphQL for the API and PostgreSQL for the database.
